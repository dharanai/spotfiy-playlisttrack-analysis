# Sptify Data analysis

## Project Overview:
This project involves analyzing Spotify playlist track data to uncover key insights about song characteristics, playlist structures, and trends in popular music. The goal is to process, store, and query the playlist track data efficiently using various data analysis techniques, leveraging SQL and other tools for comprehensive exploration.

## Key Objectives:
*  Data Acquisition: Collect track-level and playlist-level data from Spotify's API or dataset containing curated playlists and their respective tracks.
*  Data Storage: Store the data in a relational database for easier querying and further analysis.
*  Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA): Analyze key features of tracks such as tempo, key, duration, and popularity to find correlations and trends.
*  SQL Querying: Use SQL techniques to run various queries on the stored data, such as finding the most popular tracks, analyzing playlist characteristics, and determining song similarities based on features.
*  Data Visualization: Create visual representations of the data to showcase insights from the analysis.

## Dataset:
The dataset consists of Spotify playlist and track information, including but not limited to:

* Track names
* Artists
* Playlist genres
* Track features (danceability, energy, tempo, loudness, key, duration, etc.)
* Track popularity
* Release dates

## Tool used:
* SQL :- Used for querying the dataset and performing complex joins and aggregations.
* Tableau :- For building interactive visual dashboard.

## SQL Techniques:
*  Joins: Used to combine track and playlist data from multiple tables for a more comprehensive analysis.
* Aggregate Functions: To calculate metrics like average song popularity, total track duration, etc.
* Subqueries: To filter and refine data, such as finding the most popular songs within certain genres.
* Group by: Used to analyze trends in tracks based on various categorical variables.
* IndexingL To optimize the performance of frequent queries on large dataset.
